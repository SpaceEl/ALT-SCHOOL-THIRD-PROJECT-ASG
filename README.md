# ALT-SCHOOL-THIRD-PROJECT-ASG

## Introduction
This documentation provides an overview and usage guide for the Bash script that automates the setup and configuration of multiple virtual machines (VMs) for a development environment. The script uses Vagrant and SSH to create and configure VMs, create users, set up a LAMP stack, and test PHP functionality.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is installed on your system.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is installed for Vagrant to manage virtual machines.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the Bash script:

1. **Edit Configuration (Optional):** You can modify the script variables at the beginning to customize the configuration. For example, you can change the username, password, VM names, and configurations.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where the Bash script is located.
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     bash script.sh
     ```

3. **Script Execution:**
   - The script will create and configure two VMs: "master" and "slave."
   - It will start both VMs and perform the following tasks:
     - User management, including creating a user, setting up sudo access, and configuring SSH keys.
     - Inter-node communication by copying the public key from the "master" VM to the "slave" VM.
     - File transfer from "master" to "slave."
     - Process monitoring on the "master" VM.
     - Setup of a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on both VMs.
     - Testing PHP functionality by creating test files and providing URLs for testing.

## Important Notes
- This script is intended for setting up a specific development environment with two VMs and automating various configuration and provisioning tasks.
- Please review the script and ensure that it meets your specific requirements and security considerations before use.
- Always follow best practices for security when using SSH, including managing passwords and keys.
